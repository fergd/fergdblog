<p>My grandad's old clock,<br>
    used when he visited. I<br>
    remember good times.</p>

<p>3AM awake.<br>
    Quiet hoots in the cold morn&mdash;<br>
    There’s my friend, the owl.</p>

<p>Cold steam on pavement.<br>
    Winter snow shifts its form to<br>
    escape what man built.</p>

<p>Owl calls from outside.<br>
    My child, we wait and listen<br>
    for just one more call.</p>

<p>I lean back to chill,<br>
    But the seat cushion won’t stay still.<br>
    I now sit forward.</p>

<p>Deep snow takes in sound.<br>
    Keeping all the sounds secret<br>
    Until the spring comes.</p>

<p>Humans tend to break<br>
    If you hold them too tightly<br>
    Love with open arms.</p>

<p>White wine, maybe red<br>
    Free my mind so I can write<br>
    Or perhaps just nap.</p>

<p>Thumping heard upstairs.<br>
    Door handle, footsteps creeping...<br>
    Go back to bed now!</p>

<p>Waiting for my wine.<br>
    Wait for my love to return.<br>
    Each one rewards me.</p>

<p>Light snow starts the day.<br>
    The Fog rolls in, hiding snow.<br>
    Fog clears. Still snowing.</p>

<p>This beer isn't good,<br>
    but the brewery is close<br>
    So the beer is great.</p>
