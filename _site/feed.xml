        <title>Door To Door Organics Recipe Site Case Study</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;case-study-1-recipe--meal-planning-site&quot;&gt;Case Study 1: Recipe &amp;amp; Meal Planning Site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;company-background&quot;&gt;Company Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Door To Door Organics is an online organic produce and market delivery service that covers five locations nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-goal&quot;&gt;Project Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the company’s commitment to their customers eating good food, Door To Door Organics decided to launch a recipe and meal planning “wing” to the website that would ultimately be incorporated into the future website shopping flow. The recipe site would bring the customer’s grocery box, with all of its ingredients, together with recipes to help provide inspiration in the kitchen and reduce food waste. This project would require:
- A brand new design and code infrastructure
- An engaging user experience that would be easy to use and make people want to come back
- Ultimately growth in customer engagement, retention, and sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-role&quot;&gt;Project Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the designer on a three person team that also included a web developer and product manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kristin Lindquist - Product Manager&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Rudder - Senior Software Developer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christan Fergus - Senior Web Designer&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;useability-design&quot;&gt;Useability Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was an added feature that was not necessary to our customer’s core experience of modifying their orders and buying products. It was therefore important we make the recipe site extremely easy to use as a valuable enhancement to an existing shopping experience. We achieved this by endeavouring to only show the user relevant and meaningful information. Discovering the line between too little and too much was and is an on-going process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-amp-front-end-design&quot;&gt;Visual &amp;amp; Front-end Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design process started quickly based on the product manager’s wireframes and design briefs.  Moving quickly into this phase allowed us to get a good feel for how the design was going to work very early on. Working in an Agile environment provided the needed flexibility to revisit, test, and is some cases do away with concepts and designs throughout the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front end leveraged HTML5 and some newer elements of CSS3, however the requirement of supporting Internet Explorer 7 and up prohibited anything too fancy. Javascript was used a fair amount and necessary for not only enhancing the visual experience, but also as a conduit to serve up content via Ajax in some cases. Great care was taken to only use Javascript when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-end-design&quot;&gt;Back-end Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rudder handled the software development, and we worked together through the whole project. The back end of the site was built utilizing the Java framework, Play. This, of course, was the core of the web site. Some requirements and complexities included:
- The ability to quickly sift through the user’s customer data, thus showing them relevant recipes based on their order and seasonal factors
- The ability to purchase products directly from recipes
- Provide a custom CMS for easy recipe input by the Door To Door team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-testing&quot;&gt;User Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User testing was implemented late in the process, something that since has been modified in our team’s creative process, but we did do live user testing, think-aloud, and A/B testing and continue to perform tests even after release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t a static recipe site, this was a recipe site that recommended recipes to you based on items that were in your weekly order. Because of this we needed to be able to detect which ingredients you had and didn’t have, and give you the ability to modify your order based on this information. The marriage of sales and recipes was a great one, but a concept full of complexity that had to be distilled and offered up quickly for the customer’s benefit. Knowing what data to give, when to give it, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, was a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a fair amount of information we needed to convey to the user in a very limited space. Part of the space limitation was because the recipe site was built as an evolutionary branch off of the existing site. That design presented limitations primarily because we didn’t want each area of the site looking drastically different to the user. We handled this challenge by reigning the design back in some places, removing elements that weren’t expressly needed, and also modifying some visual elements the existing site in minor ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results-amp-beyond-release&quot;&gt;Results &amp;amp; Beyond Release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback and site usage were extremely positive and we successfully created a fun and meaningful way for customers to plan their week in recipes. As a result we experienced 
- Overall customer retention increased with a 17% increased customer conversion rate
- On average 13% larger basket size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Door To Door Organics recipe site has been live and active now for some time, we continue to respond to the data we receive and adjust accordingly. Since the original release, we have had a V1.5 release where we fixed some bugs and polished some functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reviving Craftsmanship</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-all-the-things&quot;&gt;Try All The Things!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing about doing web development with a team (opposed to working alone in my musty basement) is the conversations we have about the industry. The conversations, often spirited, range from the technical to the philosophical. The one thing most topics have in common is the fact that what may be “current” and “interesting” today is not what was yesterday, and certainly is not going to be tomorrow. The tech world—a world I have chosen to be a part of—moves at a dizzying pace. No sooner had I grasped Grunt than Gulp came along as the hipster designer’s favourite way of getting out of doing things manually. Which javaScript framework should I go with? Damned if I know! And then we have the latest languages, meta languages named after various facial hair configurations. When SoulPatch.io hits GitHub (and you know it will), I’m going to take a long vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t misunderstand, I love this (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/&quot; title=&quot;Web Comic on CommitStrip called Side Project&quot;&gt;appropriately illustrated here&lt;/a&gt;).I love how quickly we can get an app up and running with tools like Meteor. This fairly new stage in development has such a low bar of entry that very nearly anyone with a computer and desire can create a web page or app and even be successful. Success, however, in no way means quality. That, dear reader, ultimately leads me to my gripe. We have so much we can do, and sometimes bounce so quickly from tool to tool, that we forget a little thing called craftsmanship. Or perhaps it’s not even forgotten, perhaps—actually likely—people never had it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-physical&quot;&gt;Get Physical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a degree in graphic design. In my day (that’s right, I said it) design was a pretty slow thing. For a comprehensive design degree, one had to learn the breadth of the visual: the fine arts encompassed painting, pastel, pencil, film photography, and mixed media. Of those mediums, the areas of figure study, still life, landscape, industrial, and more where explored. These were physical mediums. These mediums did not have an undo. I was forced to hone my craft and grow my skills one mistake and success at a time. I had to plan, coordinate and execute nearly flawlessly to even hope to get a good grade. Of course, this wasn’t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that long ago. We did the physical in tandem with the digital where we did all the usual things in the Corel, the Adobe suite: advertising and marketing design, web design, posters, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I took two technical writing classes to craft and learn how to clearly communicate. In all this, I took one whole HTML class where I wrote the markup in Windows 98’s Notepad and did all my layout in tables (this was before Zeldman’s seminole &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards&quot;&gt;Designing with Web Standards&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I saying? I suppose I’m saying that I see lots of stuff being put out there by talented and the un-alike, that lacks that craft. It may look good on the surface, but a closer look shows that stuff just isn’t right. That massive image at the top of a website with a big fat arrow pointing down-really? This is good design? A physical example of this is illustrated so well by the Chinese knock-off industry. Cars… devices… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest I be the first to cast a stone, be aware I’m pointing some fingers right back at myself on this one. It’s precisely because it’s so easy to crank stuff out that I too hop on the bandwagon. With little concern for architecture or standards, I can churn out something pretty powerful pretty quickly. Yes, there is a benefit to that. If you approach something in a lean manor, you get something out quickly and iterate the shit out of it. If you have the discipline to do so, I say continue on, good sir/madame and we shall clean and refactor as we go. But do we? When we’re doing our own thing, do we finely craft our architecture? Do we take the time to truly understand our users and craft an experience to their needs? Do we spend time on the finer points of visual design all for the hope that the user never notices our finely adjusted line-height, but subconsciously has an easier time navigating and finding the information they need? I think we should—at least more than we currently do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--S2Y1CUFy--/18lg3mkpt0h8cjpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chinese version of the Mini&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-crafty&quot;&gt;Get Crafty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distinction should be made here, however. There’s stuff you ship, and there’s stuff you experiment with. It’s true, we could spend so much time “crafting” that we never ship, and I agree with Jobs that great artists ship, but crafting doesn’t mean not shipping. It means refining our process to allow room for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to craft an experimental app I’m working on. I am, however, going to craft anything anyone other than my wife is going to see. I owe that to you, the user. If you dain me worthy enough to show you anything I have worked on, it’s the least I can do to craft, tailor and make your experience in my design as useful and lovely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
