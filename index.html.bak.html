		<h2>Front-end Code</h2>
		<p>It’s paramount that the code running a site is light-weight, elegantly written, and accessible to all users and platforms. My passion resides in standards-based design, HTML, CSS (by way of Sass), DRY coding principles, and the utilization of pattern libraries.</p>

		<h2>Web Design</h2>
		<p>Great web design means understanding the user's needs and coupling that with a beautiful, useable interface. I believe beauty is nothing without clear content, which is why I design interfaces that speak not only to beauty, but also interfaces that tell a story.</p>

		<h2>User Experience</h2>
		<p>Navigating a web site should not feel like a scavenger hunt. I determine the user’s needs through user testing and research. I then use that information to provide the best, most informative, and painless experience on the website.</p>
