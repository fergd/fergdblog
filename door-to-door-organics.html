		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="span_1_of_3 stats">
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>By analyzing existing customer's product card behavior, exposing customer pain points, and weighing business requirements, my team and I produced an informed, tested design.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span_1_of_3 stats">
			<h4>Collaboration</h4>
			<p>The business had grown in what it offered & in ways it wanted to show customers products since the last iteration of the product card. Because of this, various departments had a seat at the table and were kept informed of the entire design process.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span_1_of_3 stats">
			<h4>Success</h4>
			<p>The new card proved immediately successfull primarily becuase the design was data driven. Sales rose on pages that utilized the new card and customers responded well to the updated ease-of-use.</p>

	<h2>Landing Page</h2>
	<p>The case with this, and any landing page for that matter, is to capture the potential customer in order to convert them. This landing page was constantly tested and iterated to ensure users got the information they needed and ultimately headed to the sign up pages.</p>
	<p>A/B, heatmap, preference testin, and more tests were run to gather data on the user's behaviour and preferences.</p>
