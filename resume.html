<p>I help teams up-level their operational impact. I see design as a function the same as engineering: designers are makers, therefore their time needs to be treated as such. </p>

<p>Introduced work tracking to my the design organization, and over the course of a year increased team velocity and productivity by 60% with 100% adoption of designers tracking work.</p>

<p>Built out a new feature-focused design function which spanned our owner and employee customer segments, something which hadn't been done before. Grew that team from one to six. This spanning of user segments led to increased collaboration with product, engineering, and design and shaped how teams serving each user segment built products with greater awareness on how their work effected the other persona. This has overall resulted in a 10% revenue growth. </p>


<p>An immediate adopter of AI tools and AI in products, I led my team to adopting new ways of working, specifically leveraging prototyping tools to get user insights faster. We reduced the time from concept to build by at least two sprints (1 month) and increased our ability to learn and adapt to user feedback more quickly, meaning releases were more successfull.</p>

<p>Led my team in always using AI as sources for solutions, which led to innovative ways of sourcing data from our users to then turn around and make smart decisions which enabled our user's to do less and us do more for them.</p>

<p>Authored a guide on how to design the "Homebase Assistant Journey" which outlined how do ensure that will AI (assistants) we design for emotion, brought the user along the way, etc. This guide served as a framework to build within when we built AI solutions for our customers.</p>
