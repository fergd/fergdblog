## The website of Christan Fergus

Originally this was a conversion experiment of my website to use the Jekyll platform. Now it's completely converted using Jekyll and Gulp to deploy to GH Pages. This will continue to be my platform for improving concepts and designs since one's own website is the best place to do these sorts of things.
