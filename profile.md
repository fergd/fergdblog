## The Man Behind The <pre><code>< ! - -</code>Markup<code>- - ></code></pre> ##

I'm a front-end web designer based in the Denver metro area of beautiful Colorado. Armed with degrees in both graphic and web design (not to mention years of real world experience), I know a thing or two about creating effective designs, usable interfaces, and prim and proper markup.

It's not all work, though. I dabble in audio production, hike the hilly hills of the Rocky Mountains, fancy myself a coffee connoisseur (I co-created a coffee shop once), and listen to a lot of NPR. Yes, listening to NPR is an activity. "Wow," you say, "what does this fellow not do?". Well, I don't ski, surf, or eat flan. I really, really don't like flan.

When it comes to my work, however, I'm truly passionate. I love writing beautiful and clean HTML and CSS. I'm constantly looking for ways to achieve the most efficient design&mdash;both visually and in the code. I relentlessly test and scrutinize my designs so I know the user will always be able to achieve their goals, which in turn, will help you achieve yours.
