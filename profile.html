<p>{{ page.subtitle }}</p>

<p>I'm a UX designer / developer based in the Denver metro area of beautiful Colorado. Armed with degrees in both graphic and web design (not to mention years of real world experience), I know a thing or two about creating effective designs, usable interfaces, and prim and proper markup.</p>

<p>It's not all work, though. I'm a big fan of sports car endurance racing (think pinnacle of automotive engineering and tracks with a lot of twisty bits). I dabble in audio production, hike the hilly hills of the Rocky Mountains, and fancy myself a bit of a coffee connoisseur (I co-created and managed a coffee shop in my early days).</p>

<p>When it comes to my work, however, I'm truly passionate. I thoroughly enjoy the life cycle of the user's experience, from testing, wireframing, design, and implementation. I love writing beautiful and clean HTML and Sass (CSS). I'm constantly looking for ways to achieve the most efficient design&mdash;both visually and in the code. I believe having access to the web is a human right, and we should remove any barriers that exist between any user&mdash;regardless of ability&mdash;and the power of the web. Because of this, I relentlessly test and scrutinize my designs so I know the user will always be able to achieve their goals, which in turn, enables the business achieve theirs.</p>

<p>Giving back is also important to me, which is why I teach web design at community college. Not only do I get to share my experiences, I’m forced to keep learning from the industry and even my students.</p>
