        <h2>Life/work balance</h2>
        <p>I try to spend as much time away from screens as I do in front of them. Most days, that means being outside, soaking up the sun and getting my hands dirty in the garden. Over time, I’ve become a bit of a <a href="https://yardbird.observer" target="_blank">backyard bird watcher<i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>. My yard’s turned into a small city sanctuary for birds and pollinators. Squirrels, however, are not welcome. We have a long-standing feud.</p>
        <p>When I’m not outside, I’m probably in the garage <a href="https://pricklypeteswork.shop" target="_blank">Woodworking<i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>. And when I’m not there, I’m likely in the kitchen baking sourdough or fermenting whatever happens to be on hand (sauerkraut, hot sauce, you name it).</p>
        <p>All of it: gardening, tinkering, baking, bird-watching; it keeps me grounded. It gives me the clarity and energy I need to do great work when I’m back at the laptop.</p>

        <h2>The Day My Career Changed</h2>
        <p>Of course, the values that shape my personal life absolutely carry over into my work. At the core of it, I care about helping people. Afterall, that’s what user experience design is all about.</p>
        <p>Back in 2015, I went to An Event Apart in Seattle. The last talk of the conference was from Eric Meyer, called <a href="https://youtu.be/M7z80VqX2rQ" target="_blank">“Designing for Crisis”<i class="icon icon-external"></i></a>. In it, he shared a raw and heartbreaking account of navigating unfamiliar hospitals and cities while his daughter was critically ill. It was a gut-punch of a talk. His point? We design too often for users in ideal situations. But real life isn’t neat. It’s chaotic, emotional, and messy. If we don’t consider that, we fail the people we’re trying to serve.</p>
        <p>That talk hit me hard—and it stuck. It reshaped how I think about design, and why it matters. I haven’t looked at my work the same way since, and because of that, it feels a little less like work.</p>
