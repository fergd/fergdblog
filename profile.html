		<p>The non-work side to me enjoys getting my hands dirty in my yard, and getting them very dirty messing around with my car.</p>
		<p>Once I've washed my hands, I partake in various kinds of fermentation. I brew my own beer. I've made peach wine with Colorado peaches, and various varieties of awful ciders.</p>
		<p>Beyond beer, I've nurtured a sourdough starter (Pat) for the past three years. From that I bake an insanely scrumptious sourdough bread, and have garnered fame in a 1-block radius over my sourdough cinnamon roles. All those recipes are entirely my own and have taken years to perfect given the mile-high elevation quirks, yeast properties, and our family taste preferences. I'm proud of that. Really, I just like to be in the kitchen.</p>
		<p>I've been known to dabble in music and write the odd haiku. I stay well-away from the mountains in the winter, and don't get up to them nearly enough in the summer.</p>
