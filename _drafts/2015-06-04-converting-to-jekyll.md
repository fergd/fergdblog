## Converting christanfergus.com To Jekyll
I had been needing to add a blog component to my site for quite a while, but did not want to go the Wordpress route. Jekyll was the logical choice. 

I like Jekyll because the approach you use is how I like to think about how I make my sites. Beyond that, it's relatively straight-forward and keeps you in control of just about every aspect of your website. 

### Tools
* prose.io 
* jekyll bootstrap (reference only)
* [This guy's blog](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/) to help me configure the DNS correctly
* github pages (of course)
