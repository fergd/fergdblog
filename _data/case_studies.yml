  metrics:

  role: "UX lead (joined mid-project)"
  goal: "Clarify and deliver a voice communication feature to replace radio chatter in the field."
  approach:
    - "Took on design leadership of off shore team."
    - "Rewrote and organized stories based on dispatcher needs and backend limits."
    - "Mapped user/system flows, created edge-case UI states, and built a working prototype."
  lesson: "The project started as an idea based on flawed assumptions. While skeptical when I came onto the project, I did not push hard enough to pause and validate the need. So I picked up the project and kept it moving. It was a lesson that to replace something that is already rock-solid (radios, in this case) you have to have something truly better and truly compelling. This feature had none of those things."
