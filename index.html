		<h2>The User's Experience</h2>
		<p>UX is not a style, it's an holistic approach to the breadth of the experience. Great web design means understanding the user's needs and coupling that with a beautiful, useable interface. Navigating a web site should not feel like a scavenger hunt. I determine the user’s needs through user testing and research. I then use that information to provide the best, most informative, and painless experience on the website.</p>

		<h2>The Front End</h2>
		<p>It’s paramount that the code running a site is light-weight, elegantly written, and accessible to all users and platforms. My passion resides in standards-based design, HTML, CSS (by way of Sass), DRY coding principles, and the utilization of pattern libraries. </p>
