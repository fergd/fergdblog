		<h2>The User's Experience</h2>
		<p>UX is an holistic approach to the breadth of an experience. Great web design means understanding the user's needs and coupling that with a beautiful, useable interface. Navigating a web site should not feel like a scavenger hunt.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I determine the user’s needs through user testing, data, and research. I then use that information to provide the best possible, most informative, and painless experience on the website.</p>

		<h2>The Code</h2>
		<p>It’s paramount that the code running a site is light-weight, elegantly written, and accessible to all users and platforms. Naked markup starts out responsive and accessible, it’s our job as good web designers to keep it that way.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My passion resides in standards-based design, HTML, CSS (by way of Sass), JavaScript when necessary, DRY coding principles, and the utilization of pattern libraries.</p>
