        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Update existing design to make it responsive.</li>
            <li>Convert to a React component.</li>
            <li>Update purchasing actions removing any UX barriers &amp; encourage more purchasing.</li>
            <li>Design something lovely.</li>

                <div>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>By analyzing existing customer's product card behavior, exposing customer pain points, and weighing business requirements, my team and I produced an informed, tested design.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                    <p>The business had grown in what it offered & in ways it wanted to show customers products since the last iteration of the product card. Because of this, various departments had a seat at the table and were kept informed of the entire design process.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Success</h4>
                    <p>The new card proved immediately successfull primarily becuase the design was data driven. Sales rose on pages that utilized the new card and customers responded well to the updated ease-of-use.</p>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Update existing navigation layout &amp; design to make it responsive</li>
            <li>Must work on old and updated pages alike</li>
            <li>Reduce code duplication</li>
            <li>Enable the customer to navigate shop departments more easily</li>
            <li>Provide various company departments the ability to highlight categories or incentives.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <div class="flex-group">
                <div>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>Initial research was conducted based on exisiting known customer/company pain points of navigating the website.</p>
                    <p>Three different design wireframes were initially tested on users to see which layouts performed the best.</p>
                    <p>The two leading layouts then moved to the mockup stage and were then tested to see which performed the best.</p>
                    <p>The final design was implemented, and continued to be tested long after release. These tests drove minor layout tweaks as needed.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                    <p>The navigation touched many aspects of the company, namely customer service, marketing and merchandising. We worked very closely with each team to find out needs/desires and worked to incorporate those into the design.</p>
                    <p>On top of that, we made sure that no feature we implemented put extra pressure on each team to support.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Success</h4>
                    <p>Sales tremendously increased with updated navigation and new "hot spots" where identified enabling merchandising to strategically place categories in front of customers.</p>
                    <p>Customer service complaints/issues directly dealing with navigational issues dramatically decreased.</p>
                    <p>The customer experience was greatly improved on mobile devices. With the navigation being converted to on-demand panels, the user was able to focus on content and only access the navigation when they needed it.</p>
