## Entry 1: Coming to terms ##

I am actually very anti-materialism. I like to live my life as simply as possible. The accumulation of "things" is something that quite frankly is disgusting to me. I'm a complete hypocrite, though, because I collect worthless, pointless Hot Wheels cars. I love them because I love cars, and I know it's most likely as close as I'll ever get to owning an Aston Martin V12 Vantage, or better yet, a V8-powered toilet. 

I have a lot of cars. I must figure out a way to not buy duplicate cars. I may have a problem, but having multiples is over the line, even for me. I need a solution. Clearly, it must be a digital solution. I must be able to easily use it with my non-descript handheld device. I'm sure a simple database app, or even a Hot Wheels app exists for this purpose. I should&mdash;shut your filthy face, Fergus. You're a developer, it doesn't matter if there are a hundred apps doing exactly what you want, you make your own damn app because that's what developers do! 

## Entry 2: How the Hell Do I Make An App? ##

There a many ways I could go with this. A framework? Nah. All Node? Maybe. Try out react? Not yet. I'll ask around on Twitter. A few people have mentioned Meteor. Okay, I'll give it a try. * Google Google Google Google Google Google * So here are some resources I've found useful, right off the bat. Perhaps if someone finds this diary entry, they will to.

## Entry 3: What Am I Actually Building? ##

### What's my end goal? ###
1. I must be able to quickly and easily search for a car (with or without a data connection) 
2. I want to record a car if I don't have it and I buy it
3. I'd like to see all the cars I own
4. Perhaps I'll allow other people to use this, so a log in system is necessary

### What's my process? ###

1. I will design out a couple ideas first. I'll be as creative as I want. 
2. I'll put the designs away and focus on the data next. How do I want to structure it? A Google Sheets spreadsheet is the perfect place to test this out.
