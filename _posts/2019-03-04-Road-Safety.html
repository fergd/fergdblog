<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Road Safety is a device, like a "black box", which is installed in an emergency vehicle. The device monitors various aspects of the vehicle and crew's performance. The goal of Road Safety is to increase safety, and decrease fleet costs.</p>
<p>My role was to take the raw data, and synthesize it into easy-to-understand data points for fleet and EMS managers. These are examples of multiple iterations of different views.</p>
