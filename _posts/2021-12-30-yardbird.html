    <p>The goal of this website was to make it as simple and impactful as possible. It is a static site and all the bird data is supplied by a yml file. The only JavaScript is for displaying the current year. Other than that it's simply HTML and CSS hosted by Github Pages. Despite its simplicity, it's fully responsive and even adapts to light and dark modes.</p>
