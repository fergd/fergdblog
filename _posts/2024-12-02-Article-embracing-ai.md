As a UX designer, I know how much we all wish for the perfect world: one with ample time to iterate, test, and refine designs until they’re just right. But let’s be real. Tight deadlines, shifting roadmaps, and last-minute changes rarely leave room for that ideal process. It’s all too easy to fall into a rut of designing one thing and moving forward with it because, well, time doesn’t wait.

I also understand the hesitation some of us feel about AI. It’s new, it’s powerful, and yes, it can feel a little intimidating. But here’s the thing—AI isn’t here to replace our UX creativity; it’s here to enhance it. Tools like Claude and v0 can help us do what we do best: create. With just a prompt, they can generate multiple variations of a design concept in minutes. You can poke, prod, and iterate with real code. That means more ideas, more inspiration, and more opportunities to land on a design that truly works for the user.

Think of AI as a creative partner, not a competitor. It takes care of the heavy lifting during those early exploratory phases, so we can focus on fine-tuning and making the real human-centered decisions. In a way, AI can help us become even more human-centered!

Getting comfortable with AI isn’t about surrendering control; it’s about taking back time and using it wisely. The best design isn’t always the first one—sometimes it even comes out of left field. And AI can help us get there, faster and better.
