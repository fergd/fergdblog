<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is an example of non-functional user experience requirements I have developed over the years. This set of requirements serve as a development guide, and are designed to be augmented and modified to a team and product's requirements. The requirements match and are intertwined with the generally recognized <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">10 usability heuristics for interface <i class="i icon icon-external"></i></a></p>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. However, this set can serve as a good baseline and starting point for any software application.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>User understands the state of the system at all times</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The user should know their actions are being interpreted by the system</li>
    <li>The user should know if something is loading as a result of their action</li>
    <li>The user should be prompted by the system if something requires their attention or action</li>
</ul>
<p>Heuristic: "Visibility of system status".</p>
<h3>Processing & Response times</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pages and data should load w/in n seconds</li>
    <li>Components should update w/in n seconds after the user makes a request</li>
    <li>Provide an indication the system is working</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do not refresh the page for new or updated content</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Components and their data should update independent of the page</li>
    <li>Do not perform page refreshes for new data unless the user is navigating to a logically different area/page of the site</li>
</ul>
<h3>User has control of how they navigate through the system</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Do not move the user to another page unless they choose to do so</li>
    <li>Do not place the user in obscure locations in the system</li>
    <li>Warn the user if they are about to leave the website or software product, and give them the option to abort or proceed</li>
</ul>
<p>Heuristic: "User control and freedom".
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Markup is to be well-formed to allow the content to be easily understood.</li>
    <li>Where at all possible, the content should be available and understandable when styles and JavaScript are not enabled</li>
    <li>Colors and contrast should be tested to make sure they are visible to anyone with most sight disabilities</li>
    <li>Important content should be immediately visible in the UI&mdash;Do not reveal important content via gestures, mouse hovers, or clicks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Front End Accessibility</h3>
<p>UX, UI developers are able to audit front end pages and understand, at least on a basic level, what the code is doing</p>
<h3>Security/Roles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The application must support multiple roles associated with the logged in user</li>
    <li>The application must allow UI elements to be shown to the user that are relevant to the user based the their specific role(s)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Localization</h3>
<p>The system must use localization techniques that will allow for strings and other elements (such as dates & currency) to be localized to match the user's preferred language and culture</p>
