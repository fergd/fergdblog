<p>There's something about making food in a cast iron skillet, and these cinnamon rolls are no exception. Here's an extraordinarily tasty cinnamon roll that is sure to please everyone!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Dough</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small chunks</li>
	<li>425<sub>g</sub> bread flour</li>
	<li>140<sub>g</sub> sourdough starter</li>
	<li>1Tbsp honey</li>
	<li>1cup greek yogurt (preferably homemade)</li>
	<li>3/4tsp salt</li>
	<li>1tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>1/2tsp baking soda</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>1cup brown sugar</li>
<li>3tbsp cinnamon</li>
<li>1 stick unsalted butter, warmed and soft but not completely melted</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Icing</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 block cream cheese (room temp)</li>
<li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>200<sub>g</sub> powdered sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>At least 7 hours before you're ready to bake, prepare the dough for a long fermentation. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. Stir in starter, honey, and yogurt until a soft dough comes together. The goal is to combine the ingredients well but not knead too much. You should expect lumps of butter evenly distributed througout. Cover and let the dough ferment for a minimum of 7 hours and a max of 12.</li>
	<li>When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350&#176;F</li>
	<li>Combine salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl until evenly mixed. Sprinkle the mixture over your dough and knead until it comes together into a cohesive, workable dough.</li>
	<li>In a bowl, combine the filling ingredients until they form a paste.</li>
	<li>Roll dough out into a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick rectangle, roughly 12 inches long by 7 or 8 inches wide...roughly...</li>
	<li>Spread filling over dough, placing more filling toward the end you will start rolling (to minimize too much leaking out by the time you've rolled all the dough up).</li>
	<li>Starting with the long edge of the dough closest to you, roll the dough away so you end up with a nice roll that looks like a rolled-up carpet.</li>
	<li>Cut the dough into 1/2 - 1 inch pieces (ensuring each piece is equal) and place in a 12 inch cast iron skillet. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown on top.</li>
	<li>While baking, prepare the icing. Cut up the room-temp cream cheese into a mixing bowl and add vanilla and powdered sugar. Mix on high until the icing is combined and soft.</li>
	<li>Ice the cinnamon rolls when they have cooled, and enjoy!</li>
