<p>When spinning up a new product, it can be hard to know where exactly to start. That said, it's a wonderful opportunity to lay the groundwork for solid, user-focused design. I seized that opportunity with a "trilogy" of presentations I gave over the course of a week. The PDF versions of the presentations I gave can be viewed below.</p>

	<strong>Note:</strong>
	<p>In some cases I've had to edit the presentations to protect company data.</p>
