  <h3>Project Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Strategist (mid-project join)</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Clarify and deliver a voice communication feature to replace radio chatter in the field.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Validated earlier contextual findings showing fragmented communication workflows.</li>
    <li>Rewrote and organized stories based on dispatcher needs and backend limits.</li>
    <li>Mapped user/system flows, created edge-case UI states, and built a working prototype.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Feature stories unblocked: [Placeholder]</li>
    <li>Communication clarity between medics/dispatch improved: [Placeholder]</li>
    <li>Prototype reduced dev ambiguity and sprint churn: [Placeholder]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>Designing for reliability in mission-critical workflows means building trust through clarity. The visual flow and prototype brought alignment across the board, ensuring a stable and usable feature on release.</p>
