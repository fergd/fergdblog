<!-- Closing Quality Control -->
<section class="case-study">
  <h3>Project Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Product Designer</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Surface quality control data at the right time to help mortgage professionals prevent funding errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Interviews, Prototyping, User Testing, Cross-team collaboration</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Performed discovery interviews to map diverse user workflows across lending and title offices.</li>
    <li>Integrated reports into workflows through both app and email delivery mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Validated effectiveness via user testing and updated naming conventions to reflect user understanding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual effort saved per loan: 10–15 minutes</li>
    <li>Increased fee revenue: $15 per loan (~$375K/month)</li>
    <li>New clients gained due to feature: [3+ early adopters, 40+ within 6 months]</li>
    <li>User testing task success (perceived): 76.7%</li>
    <li>User testing task success (actual): 100%</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>Integrating with user workflows isn’t just ideal—it’s essential. Even the best ML-powered data is only valuable when it’s delivered in the right format, at the right moment, with clear language. That made all the difference here.</p>
