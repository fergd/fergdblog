<!-- Cloud-Based Dispatch System -->
<section class="case-study">
  <h3>Project Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Architect</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Replace legacy on-premise dispatch software with a SaaS solution that reflected real dispatcher workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Top Tasks, Story Mapping, SUS, User Testing, Wireframes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducted foundational research including top tasks and contextual inquiry.</li>
    <li>Mapped dispatcher workflows and created scalable IA and flow documentation.</li>
    <li>Built and tested interfaces to support task-focused functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>SUS improvement over legacy system: [Placeholder]</li>
    <li>Task time reduction (e.g. call creation, dispatch): [Placeholder]</li>
    <li>Adoption rate across agencies or users: [Placeholder]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>This project taught me that the system is only as good as its understanding of its environment. Building for dispatchers meant being on the floor, understanding context, and reflecting that in structure, not just surface design.</p>
