<!-- Smart Recipes Integration -->
<section class="case-study">
  <h3>Project Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX & Front-End Lead</li>
    <li><strong>Team:</strong> 1 PM, 1 Developer, Myself</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> ~3 months</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Help customers use up ingredients, reduce food waste, and grow basket size and retention by integrating recipes with grocery orders.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Led UX and UI from scratch for a brand-new digital feature built to enhance the existing shopping flow.</li>
    <li>Created a system to recommend recipes based on past purchases and seasonal availability.</li>
    <li>Worked closely with engineering to build Ajax-powered dynamic content and handle browser constraints like IE7.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Average basket size increase: [+13%]</li>
    <li>Customer conversion rate improvement: [+17%]</li>
    <li>Increased engagement and recipe interaction: [Placeholder]</li>
    <li>Support requests related to food prep or waste: [Placeholder]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <p>This work reinforced how great UX blends data, behavior, and context. By weaving recipes directly into the grocery experience, we created value that supported both the customer and the business.</p>
